# freeCodeCamp
> freeCodeCamp (also referred to as “Free Code Camp”) is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web 
platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web 
development accessible to anyone. Beginning with tutorials that introduce students to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, students progress 
to project assignments that they must complete either alone or in pairs. Upon completion of all project tasks, students are 
partnered with other nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical development experience.
